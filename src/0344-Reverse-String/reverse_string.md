# 344. Reverse String

`Easy` <br />
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** s = ["h","e","l","l","o"] <br />
> **Output:** ["o","l","l","e","h"] <br />

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"] <br />
> **Output:** ["h","a","n","n","a","H"] <br />

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s[i] is a printable ascii character.`
