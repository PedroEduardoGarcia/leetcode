# 1672. Richest Customer Wealth

`Easy` <br />
You are given an `m x n` integer grid `accounts` where `accounts[i][j]` is the amount of money the `i​​​​​​​​​​​th`​​​​ customer has in the `j​​​​​​​​​​​th`​​​​ bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.

A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]] <br />
> **Output:** 6 <br />
> **Explanation:** <br />
> 1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 <br />
> 2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 <br />
> Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6. <br />

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]] <br />
> **Output:** 10 <br />
> **Explanation:** <br />
> 1st customer has wealth = 6 <br />
> 2nd customer has wealth = 10 <br />
> 3rd customer has wealth = 8 <br />
> The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.

**Example 3:**

> **Input:** accounts = [[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]] <br />
> **Output:** 17

**Constraints:**

- `m == accounts.length`
- `n == accounts[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `1 <= accounts[i][j] <= 100`
